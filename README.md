Oasis is an interactive world model developed by [Decart](https://www.decart.ai/) and [Etched](https://www.etched.com/). Based on diffusion transformers, Oasis takes in user keyboard input and generates gameplay in an autoregressive manner. We release the weights for Oasis 500M, a downscaled version of the model, along with inference code for action-conditional frame generation. 

For more details, see our [joint blog post](https://oasis-model.github.io/) to learn more.

And to use the most powerful version of the model, be sure to check out the [live demo](https://oasis.us.decart.ai/) as well!

## Setup
```
git clone https://github.com/dgrtygry2/open-oasis.git
cd open-oasis
# Install pytorch
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
# Install other dependencies
pip install einops diffusers timm av
```
To download a premade version of this program with the models, Go to the releases.
```

## Basic Usage
Only use this if you are training any data. run "game.py" if you want to play the game offline.
```
python generate.py
```
The resulting video will be saved to `video.mp4`. Here's are some examples of a generation from this 500M model!

> Hint: try swapping out the `.mp4` input file in the script to try different environments!
